# CS 0406 - Discrete Mathematics 2 & Statistics for CS

This course is the sequel to Math 0401. It covers advanced discrete mathematics topics for computer science, including graphs, trees, Boolean algebra, and finite state machines, as well as an introduction to probability and statistics. Coursework was completed using an online "Zybook," an interactive digital textbook platform designed for STEM courses. All quizzes, assignments, and exams were completed in person, on paper— so I no longer have access to my submissions of them.

Completed in Spring of 2022 at the University of Pittsburgh, Johnstown campus.
