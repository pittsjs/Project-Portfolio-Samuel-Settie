# CS 0411 - Intro to Computer Science Programming

This course is an introduction to the core concepts, techniques, and tools of computer science, emphasizing problem analysis, algorithm development, and top-down program design. The course uses Java as its primary programming language. Exercise sets, quizzes, and exams were completed in class, on paper, so I no longer have access to my copies.

CS 0411 must be taken in tandem with the lab course, CS 0410. The lab is where hands-on coding work was completed, including 13 assignments covering core Java concepts. Seperate exams were also given for the Lab session.

Completed in Spring Term 2021-2022 at the University of Pittsburgh, Johnstown campus.

- [Assignment 3](Lab%20(CS%200410)/Assignments/Assignment%203) – Calculate future cost of an item based on yearly/daily inflation; emphasizes user input, formula application, and formatted monetary output.
- [Assignment 4](Lab%20(CS%200410)/Assignments/Assignment%204) – Determine either volume or surface area of cone or square pyramid based on user choice, utilizing nested conditional logic and parameterized input.
- [Assignment 5](Lab%20(CS%200410)/Assignments/Assignment%205) – Price tickets for adults and children with complex tiers and discounts; reinforces conditional logic and formatted tabular output.
- [Assignment 6](Lab%20(CS%200410)/Assignments/Assignment%206) – Generate a student ID from last initial, campus code, and birth month; demonstrates use of `switch` statements and string manipulation.
- [Assignment 7](Lab%20(CS%200410)/Assignments/Assignment%207) – Write two programs using `while` loops: one models an ant colony's population decrease yearly; the other sums squares of even numbers with input validation.
