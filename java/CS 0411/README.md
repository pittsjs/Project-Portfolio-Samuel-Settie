# CS 0411 - Intro to Computer Science Programming

This course is an introduction to the core concepts, techniques, and tools of computer science, emphasizing problem analysis, algorithm development, and top-down program design. The course uses Java as its primary programming language. Excercise sets, quizzes, and exams were completed in class, on paper, so I no longer have access to my copies.

CS 0411 must be taken in tandem with the lab course, CS 0410. The lab is where hands-on coding work was completed, including 13 assignments covering core Java concepts. Seperate exams 

Completed in Spring Term 2021-2022 at the University of Pittsburgh, Johnstown campus.
