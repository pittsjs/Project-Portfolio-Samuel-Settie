# CS 0455 - Algorithms and Information Structures

This course focuses on the study and analysis of essential algorithms and data structures, including stacks, queues, trees, lists, and graphs, with an emphasis on their implementation in Java. Topics include algorithm complexity, software problem-solving with discrete mathematics, and hands-on exercises in class. Regular attendance, textbook reading, quizzes, and exams were required throughout the term. Quizzes and exams were taken in class and are not available here.

**CS 0455 must be taken concurrently with the associated lab, CS 0045.** The lab is where all coding assignments were completed, with a total of 12 programming assignments. Separate exams were administered for the lab portion.

Completed in Fall Term 2022 at the University of Pittsburgh, Johnstown campus.
