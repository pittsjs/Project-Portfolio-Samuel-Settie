# Math 0401 - Discrete Mathematical Structures

This course covers essential topics such as logic, set theory, proofs, functions, relations, and counting principles, all with an emphasis on applications to computer science. Coursework was completed using an online "Zybook", 
an interactive digital textbook platform designed for STEM courses. Quizzes, group assignments, and exams were all completed in-person, on paperâ€” so I do not have access to them.
