# CS 1520 — Programming Languages for Web Applications

This course focused on front‑end and back‑end web development fundamentals through a flipped‑class format: recorded lectures were to be watched before class, and in‑class time was used for guided labs and hands‑on activities. Major topics included HTML/CSS, responsive design, client‑side JavaScript and the DOM, HTTP requests, web storage, and an introduction to server‑side development with Flask, templates (Jinja2), and SQLAlchemy.

Completed in Fall Term 2024-2025 at the University of Pittsburgh, main campus.
