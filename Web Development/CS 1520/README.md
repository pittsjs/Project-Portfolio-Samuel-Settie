# CS 1520 — Programming Languages for Web Applications

This course focused on front‑end and back‑end web development fundamentals through a flipped‑class format: recorded lectures were to be watched before class, and in‑class time was used for guided labs and hands‑on activities. Major topics included HTML/CSS, responsive design, client‑side JavaScript and the DOM, HTTP requests, web storage, and an introduction to server‑side development with Flask, templates (Jinja2), and SQLAlchemy.

Completed in Fall Term 2024-2025 at the University of Pittsburgh, main campus.

[projects/](projects) — Hands-on web programming projects

- [sjs249_finalProject/](projects/sjs249_finalProject) — **Restaurant Flask App**  
  This project involved creating a full-featured restaurant menu and ordering system as a Flask web application. Customers can scan a table QR code to view the menu, select dishes, and place orders that were instantly sent to the kitchen staff interface. The backend uses Flask and SQLAlchemy, and the app is deployed on PythonAnywhere. The project required endpoint routing, database models, dynamic order updates, and QR code integration.

  This application is still functional, you can access the website by scanning the QR codes [in this folder](projects/sjs249_finalProject/qrCodes/)

- [sjs249_midtermProject/](projects/sjs249_midtermProject) — **Car Dealer Web App (Midterm Project)**  
  *Part 1:* Designed a car dealer application using HTML, CSS, and responsive design. The interface featured dropdown menus and image placeholders for Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Mustang models, with color and insurance options, and a dynamically updating info area.
  
  *Part 2:* Extended the app with JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The project added dynamic color options and image changes based on car selection, responsive event-driven updates (including insurance choice), and a modular class-based script. This single-page app showcased how modern JavaScript can make web pages interactive and user-driven. Both project PDFs are provided within the project folders for complete project context.
