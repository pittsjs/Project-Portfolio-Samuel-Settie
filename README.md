# Project Portfolio 

## Samuel Settie

This repository serves as a portfolio of my college coding projects completed during my time at the University of Pittsburgh, as well as other personal projects.

# About this Repository

Projects in this monorepo are divided into subfolders based on the primary coding language or project area. Some subfolders are dedicated to distinct languages, such as Java or Python, while others are organized by broader topics like web development or assembly language. Where relevant, project folders or files may reference course codes such as “CS 0007” or “CS 1550.” Lower numbered courses (CS 0007) correspond to early curriculum classes, while higher numbered courses (CS 1550) denote later, more advanced curriculum classes.
